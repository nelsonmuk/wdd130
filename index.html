<h2> Nelson Mukwinya</h2>
<h2> Fatso</h2>
<p>Hello everyone. My name is Nelson F. Mukwinya. Originally, I am from Zimbabwe; currently, I am living in Turkey</p> 
<p>I am married, and I have a daughter who is three years old. I am studying web design, and my goal is to be the best web designer. 
  <p>  I love traveling and playing soccer. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for 3 years now  </p>
   <p>   My favorite quote is “Obedience allows God’s blessings to flow without constraint. He will bless His obedient children with freedom from bondage and misery. And He will bless them with more light.”― Russell M. Nelson </p>
